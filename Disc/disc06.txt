access names in parent frames, but not able to modify 
nonlocal canbe to modify a binding in a parent frame

def stepper(num):
    def step():
        nonlocal num 
        num += 1
        return num 
    return step

each returned step function keeps its own state 

nonlocal useful for maintaining state across different calls to the same function 

two important caveats with nonlocal names:
    Global names: can not be moddified using the nonlocal keyword 
    Names in the current frame: can not be overridden using the nonlocal keyword this means we cannot have both a local and nonlocal binding with the same name in a single frame 

nonlocal lets you modify bindings in parent frames, we call functions that use it mutable functions
