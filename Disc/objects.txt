they consist of data and behavior, bundled together to create abstractions,
objects can represent things , but also properties, interactions, & precesses
a type of object is called a class, classes are first-class values in python
object-oriented programming
 a metaphor for organizing large programs
 special syntax that can improve the composition of programs

all objects have attributes
a lot of data manipulation happens through object methods
functions do one thing; objects do many related things
