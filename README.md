 Through this class, though I finished this class late 2022 and it has been 4 months since the last time I keened into it, CS61A still considered as the best lesson personally. I didn't take much time on textbook, instead, I watched every lecture, and finished homework, lab, project. I want to address, as being a basic lecture for computer science studying student, not only it helps learners have a good understanding of how to programming, as well as thories about data structure based on python, but also introduces extra programming languages for example, SQL, scheme, also make an editor(Scheme) using Python language. In addition, this class is friendly for self learning, as it has a study calender ,and composed homeworks, labs while studying. Don't forget to watch the last three lecturesÔºÅ Although it isn't really related to academic class learning, I recommend it since the Student Asisstants they recorded videos, and discussed lives and problems you may experience, they give suggestions in an open way, which is awesome and interactive.
